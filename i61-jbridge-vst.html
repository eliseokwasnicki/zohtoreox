                            <p>Приветствую вас, уважаемые читатели! Сейчас вы узнаете, как установить Cubase 5. Прямо на свой компьютер, на windows. So basically the situation I find myself in is that I'm getting back into EDM production after a LONG absence and have a lot of 32-bit VST Instruments from back in the day that I'd like to keep using. I want to learn how to use FL Studio but it looks like it is 64-bit only now as that is the only demo version I could find. My question is this, how well does the JBridge software work when it comes to allowing 32-bit VST instruments to run in a 64-bit host DAW? I would really like to run these. Just got my computer updated so I can finally install Live 10. What's the best (and possibly free?) way to convert AU plugins to 64 bit? About to spend 30$ on 'BridgeWize' but free would be excellent, I just do it as a hobby and would be absolutely amazed if I even made a penny from my music I've already tried https://jstuff.wordpress.com/jbridge/ but the UI/UX is not perfect. Also I would like to find a solution to do this once for all. and then keep the bridged .dll so if I format / reinstall Windows, I don't have to rebridge again. What solution do you use to load 32-bit As ableton doesn't bridge between 32 and 64, I'm looking for bridging software, for pc. J Bridge appears to be recommended by most, although I'm also interested to hear about any alternatives. Thanks. Title. In those daws, there's no need for anything like jbridge because they bridge automatically and natively. Why doesn't Ableton do this with Live? And yes, I realize most plugins nowadays come in 64bit, but I've got several I like from small time coders that are 32bit only, and I'd like to just be able to start them up without having to go through a bridge first. I'm especially concerned with using them live if my computer is having to run a bridge alongside see title. 
As in, will I have to re register my Ableton on my new computer and contact support to do it? Or is there simply a few steps to change it over to 64 bit on my new computer. The main thing in Ableton that annoys me so much. I hope I won't need to use jbridge to link the plugins. Hello all. Ive been wondering what would be best especially considering plug-ins because it still happens alot that my ableton 64 bit is unable to run alot of plug-ins. 64 bit would only have an advantage in huge projects right? Been in really doubt last couple of days which one to run 32 or 64 bit. Anyone's thoughts about this matter. Do I need to do anything special, do I need to uninstall my current version or anything before I do this? Not sure what would happen if I have both installed at the same time. Thanks. i recently was looking for something to make my 32bit vsts play in ableton and i came across this and used the demo. At first i did everything right and ran everything as admin, the vsts showed up in the bridge folder and i thought everything was working until i opened ableton and clicked a new vst and it immediately crashed. i deleted everything in the bridge folder and tried to do it over again now i keep getting this and it doesnt recognize any of the plugins  JBridge for mac has been giving me 200% CPU spikes for several months now and the programmer can't figure out why. I need an alternative, is JBridge the only 32-bit bridger out there Hey /r/emdproduction, I recently got jbridge in order to make my 32-bit plugins work with my 64-bit host. The problem is, whenever I open up the program, it displays a message that says: "Error saving settings file (whatever file) - please make sure you have write permissions in the folder" What am I supposed to do with this? EDIT: Here's a pic (http://i.imgur.com/or4nMLN.png). 
Hey Everyone! Basically, i downloaded the .dll files of the DSK Overture and Virtuoso VSTs, and placed them in the plugins folder. They haven't shown up in the GUI in Ableton. I have tried everything, but nothing works. Not even running in admin works. Any suggestions? Thanks This is almost everything I’ve learned in a year of making music. I say almost because a lot of your knowledge as a producer is simply from experience. This will be very long but I have split it up into sections about certain things I think are important. I’ve now been producing for a bit over a year and I have learned quite a lot about not just making music but actually being a producer. Even though I have a long way to go before I become even remotely good I have a lot to share Use 64bit host on the kontakt 32 bit dll file using jbridge and then open it up as an vst in ur DAW.It worked 
I know that there’s a program called Jbridge and it basically lets you use 32 bit VST’s in a 64 bit host. I’m speaking strictly from Ableton Live experience, if anyone has information to add, please. See dhjdhj reply below -- I am looking for chainers, not wrappers. If no one else replies, I'll repost this tomorrow, with a correct title (already crossposted this). I was wondering if there are any free or open source wrapper plugins, similar to blue cat's patchwork or MB-7? LBXStripper was recommended to me, for REAPER; but I was trying to help some one else. Not sure what these are called: (they connect two DAW's or two apps, and some can also host plugins) expert sleepe. Im using 64-bit the plugins shows up on ableton, but when i try to open they show this message "This VST is not compatible with Live" tried to jbridge them but it shows up an error that my waveshell lib isnt there but it istried to change compatibility mode but stills As we all know, Ableton Live no longer works with 32-bit VSTs. This is kind of a shame, as there are a lot of 32-bit plugs that work well with processing vaporwave clips, mixes, etc. Now, Ableton does mention that you can use jBridge to "bridge" your 32-bit plugs for 64-bit use. The only problem is. JBRIDGE SUCKS!!! Massively so, in fact. I used it for a while.and it was far from "seamless". jBridged plugs wound up being major CPU resource hogs, they could be randomly buggy with no warning. TLDR; is there a way to delete one of the folders in Cubase’s default VST folders list? Such as “distortion” or “dynamics”. One created by JBridgeM called “PluginsBridgedFor64BitVSTHosts” is causing a used-to-be 32-bit plugin which is now updated to 64-bit to still default to open in clunky JBridgeM 32-bit mode only, and not in 64bit. JBridgeM has been deleted, and the plugin won’t work at all now. Routing appears to be correct in VST Plugin manager, and in the macHD>library>audio>plugi. So basically JBridge will create 64-bit copies of your 32-bit VSTs, after which it is safe to delete those 32-bit VSTs? I have extremely limited space on this laptop. Thanks. 
Have seen how many people have had this issue. have tried a number of things, and I'm only getting a few to actually work in appear in the VST directory. Problem is, I can't remember what I did to get those particular ones working. What worked for you? I'll be trying a bunch of methods so I can get everything up and running properly. I have jBridge as well. Is it worth using that predominately. As you already know Live10 doesnt support 32-Bit VST. I wanted to ask for your solutions for this. Many VST are still released 32-Bit so they wont show up on Live10. What do you do if you need any 32-Bit VST? I am thinking of installing 32-Bit Reaper to run VSTi, import MIDI I created on Ableton, export that partition and import WAV file into Ableton for the rest. I also saw something called jBridge but is that CPU friendly? Do you know any free soltions like jBridge.
