Hey lads, My ASUS A53S Laptop (Windows 7) runs on Optimus so that the drivers should automatically switch between the Intel Integrated Graphics card and the Nvidia Geforce 610M depending on whether or not I'm playing games or not. However, Optimus is not switching to my GT610M driver when it should be when I'm playing games, so on all of my games the computer is using the mediocre Intel CPU driver, which basically makes games unplayable. It was suggested to me that I uninstall and reinstal.

So I've succesfully managed to install Arch on my laptop and everything works like a charm. However I don't know how to configure the PC to use the Nvidia card for games and applications instead of the Intel one. Is there any way to enable GPU switching. Hello, I upgraded to windows 10 and optimus started not working right. At first, the dedicated 880M GPU would stay on. To try and fix the problem, I reinstalled both the NVIDIA 880M and Intel 4600 HD drivers. I am pretty new to Linux in general, but I have already successfully installed Arch on dualboot with Manjaro, so it's not like I'm total dummy. Basically I need help with setting up Prime (so my laptop uses NVidia card as primary card in xorg), but a lot of thing are unclear, I tried doing it along with some tutorials, but managed only to break xorg. A lot of things (especially gpu drivers) is different than in Arch. My laptop is ASUS X556UQK and I would like to have an option to switch primar. Ссылки.

Nvidia Optimus is a computer GPU switching technology created by Nvidia which,  Within the hardware interface layer of the Nvidia GPU driver, the Optimus Routing Layer provides intelligent graphics management. Hi. I've struggled with this problem since I got this laptop in my hands. Everytime when I want to install nvidia drivers something goes wrong. So I'm asking for help. I'm kinda noob-ish in linux environment but here is what I know: systemctl reports (sddm) tells that sddm quited because of 'core-dump' and status=6/ABRT journalctl shows some kernel and audit related errors I think. I know that's very little information but this is my main laptop and I don't have anything but my cellphone. I though that Optimus would be supported in the latest drivers and kernel (3.9+), however, it seems like most people claims you still need to use Bumblebee, that it is only patrial, that it is fully supported 
I have a 2016 Razer Blade 15 (w/GTX1060M) and I installed Fedora 29 Cinnamon. Everything was fine until I tried to install the proprietary Nvidia drivers from the repo. There is no Software Manager in F29 Cinnamon, only dnfdragora. There is no metapackage for installing and setting up the drivers. All attempts to manually install the drivers leaves me with a black screen. The only Cinnamon distro that does the job right is Linux Mint, which is a pity as I prefer Fedora's upgrade cadence Драйвер nvidia автоматически не обнаруживается сервером Xorg, поэтому его надо сконфигурировать.  не должно выполняться на системах с Nvidia Optimus;.

I was thinking of picking up a gaming laptop with a GTX 1060 in it, something like this (https://www.reddit.com/r/LaptopDeals/comments/ao3j3p/overpowered_gaming_laptop_17_2_year_warranty/), but am a little concerned that they seem to use proprietary Windows apps for things like power management and fan control.
