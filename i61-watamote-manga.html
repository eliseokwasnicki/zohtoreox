No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular! Watashi Ga Motenai No Wa Dou Kangaete Mo Omaera Ga Warui! 1-7 volume set (Gangan Comics ONLINE) Japanese Edition.

At the tender age of 15, Kuroki Tomoko has already dated dozens and dozens of boys and she's easily the most popular girl around! The only problem is that absolutely none of that is real, and her perfect world exists only via dating games and romance shows. Rarely before has an anime series so keenly and uncomfortably struck home about the humorous travails of a social misfit. Its triumph is in creating an anti-moe protagonist who paradoxically winds. The official Twitter account for Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaete mo Omaera ga Warui! (No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular! or WATAMOTE) manga creator I don't have any money for manga or the like. Is there a free manga service that provides Watamote? I don't want to be reading and get locked out of it on the tenth book or something like that, but I would appreciate being able to read at least the first manga book. How long are the Watamote mangas. A manga reader for manga fans. Manhwa / Webtoon / Shounen / Action / Demons / Drama / Fantasy / School life / Super power / Supernatural. No offense to Tomoko, but I doubt she could have carried the series for as long as it has by her lonesome. Having a whole host of other weirdos to clash with really makes her character much more interesting! I especially loved the Disneyland arc! So many neat character interactions and development. Nemo's my favorite character for doing the opposite of every cliche by being upfront about everything. It's so nice. Excited

I’ve seen people say that Nico Tanigawa will end it at 200 chapters, and others say that it’s been losing popularity and only a few more volumes will be released in the future. Tomoko is in her third and final year after all. I would hate for the manga to end soon, I love the Watamote manga, and I’ve been reading it for quite a while. Unlike its protagonist, the series is quite popular, with the third volume selling more than 170,000 copies in the first month. In addition to an anthology and a fanbook, in January 2013 a Spin-Off, No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault My Friend's Not Popular. No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular! 私がモテないのはどう考えてもお前らが悪い! (Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dō Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui. it might be late to be asking this now since i've already seen 11/12 episodes and who knows if it will have a second season or not, but just maybe knowing anyway will be useful does Tomoko ever change? does anything really ever change? i personally thought episode 3 was the best and except for the Magic:the gathering references it has gotten stale and now its just OCD pushing me to watch each episode, does this ever change? anyone who wishes to answer might want to use spoiler I just feel sorry for her. I hope she meets a nice, understanding guy. Has this happened in the manga yet? What about that guy from episode 13? Will anything develop Hey i have recently completed watamote anime and want to find out whats going on in manga.Does her social standing in school improve? What happens to tomoki. Anyone know how long the manga series is intended to last for? From what I'm seeing it looks like this series will be covering tomokos entire high school years. Anyone know if the creators said anything about how long they want it to last? I love me some watamote goodness but I'd hate to see it go without seeing tomoko getting what she deserves. I finished the anime a long time ago, and want to read the manga. I just don't know what chapter it is where the anime 
Before saying anything I want to let anyone who reads this post know that I was not a Reddit user before seeing this anime. I knew of Reddit before but never used or surfed on it in the past, but why am I telling you this? While searching on google I found this subReddit and saw I could join it so that's exactly what I did.The only reason I came on Reddit was because of this show, after finishing all 12 episodes I wanted more and I couldn't find more I surfed google for 2 days trying I recently bought volumes 1 and 2 of the watamote manga and I like it so far, but does anyone know websites where I can read the other volumes for free without having to pay for the books. I've always loved the comedy of stuff like Konosuba, Sabagebu, Asobi Asobase, and Grand Blue. And recently I binged read the Watamote manga and loved it. I want comedy with MCs that are just pieces of shit most of the time. Sabagebu's Momoka is a greedy piece of shit who will lie and deceive people to get what she wants, and she's one of my favorite comedy characters I've ever watched. Watamote's Tomoko is so fucked up and it was so depressingly relatable but so interesting and funny. It has been a while since I translated something for this sub, I'm looking to translate a short Watamote manga with a length of about 1 to 5 pages (only counting pages with text). If someone here knows a short manga you would like to see translated, like something you saw on Pixiv or Twitter for example, or in another post, leave a comment with the link, I will translate at least one and post it here later. It could be about any thematic, and I don't mind stuff like it being about https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-02-01/watamote-manga-co-creator-breaks-left-arm-in-bicycle-accident/.127229. I was just browsing around the book store today, when while swinging around the manga section, I happened upon this (https://i.imgur.com/Vqh4a5b.jpg). Seeing some Watamote manga on sale isn't anything unusual. But what was was how it was actually tagged like this. The only other manga I saw given that treatment was the real popular stuff, like One Piece, Naruto, and Madoka. I'd like to think that maybe it means the manga is seeing an upsurge in popularity here in the States I read the watamote manga because I liked the anime. I wanted to know Tomoko's story past the arbitrary 13 episode limit.
